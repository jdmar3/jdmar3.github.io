        <title>Message to Students (TW/CW: Suicide, Death)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/unc-chapel-hill-cancels-classes-tuesday-amid-two-suicide-investigations-n1281229&quot;&gt;two UNC students died from suicide&lt;/a&gt; in one 24-hour period over this past weekend, I wrote a message to my current students this morning.
I wanted to share it more widely, so I have copied it verbatim below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health: Office hours and other activities cancelled until Thursday (TW/CW: suicide, death)&lt;/strong&gt; 
I’m canceling office hours and other activities until Thursday morning. Everyone needs to take some time this week and rest. That includes the instructional staff. So, I’m declaring an office hours hiatus until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very difficult message to write, so I am going to do so in the only way I really know how, which is to speak very frankly and personally about the multiple deaths from suicide that occurred over the weekend that just passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning around this time of the year in 2012, a few months after I had moved to Chapel Hill to start a PhD, I received a phone call from a friend in Kalamazoo, MI where I had moved from just a few weeks prior. His voice was shaky. He had called to tell me that his husband, my best friend (we’ll call him Dave), had died in the early hours of the morning, and that it had been suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that Dave had been struggling for some time. I had spent the year prior in Kalamazoo trying to be there for him. I felt like my leaving precipitated this. I felt responsible. I wanted to scream and sob, but my friend was already doing that on the phone. So, I cried softly and listened. And I went completely numb. I just shut off that part of my brain and boxed it away. I went on about my day, which included going to a workshop all day, pretending outwardly as if everything were fine. Internally, I was not okay. I was never okay again. I’m still not okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave had carved out a life for himself and seemed happy. He was loved. His husband adored him. His friends cared for him deeply. His community treated him like a celebrity when he walked into a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave experienced depression and anxiety. Dave was an alcoholic. Dave had a history of childhood and adult trauma as the result of abuse. Nothing, no amount of success or stability or external validation could remove these things. They were with him &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. And he never told anyone about them. He remained quiet about his own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know that Dave experienced suicidal ideation. None of us knew. None of the people closest to him knew that he had a plan. We didn’t know. It’s not the kind of thing that comes up in conversation. It’s not the kind of thing that people disclose: because it is terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it can happen to any of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago, I noticed a shift in the way that my mind responded to things. I have always tended to be able to push through obstacles and let setbacks roll off my back. I felt suddenly unable to do this. I withdrew. I withdrew from my friends, from my husband, from my family. I started around then to experience very strong self-harm ideation. It was not the first time in my life, but previously I had been able to make it go away. I couldn’t do that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was bad. I knew I was experiencing depression. I would have waves of it that would take me out for days. I would come out of it and feel like I had lost time. These were depressive episodes, I would later learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also increasingly experiencing anxiety attacks, which would eventually become panic attacks. I had always experienced anxiety but dealt with it largely by ignoring it. Suddenly, I couldn’t. It was about everything and nothing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept all of this to myself because I didn’t want to burden anyone else with it. I didn’t want my friends and family and colleagues to know because I was embarrassed that I somehow couldn’t handle things. I was also scared. Acknowledging it made it feel real. I didn’t want it to be real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing for me that changed everything was when I woke up one morning and those intrusive thoughts refused to go away. Nothing I did turned down their volume. Their pitch had also changed somehow. Instead of just being about harm, they had become more ominous. I was thinking idly about ways to end my life. That had never happened before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started that day to look for a therapist. It was difficult. I had asked my doctor to assess me for anxiety and they told me to lose some weight and lower my blood pressure. I contacted multiple therapists without receiving a response or only to be told that they were not taking new patients at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this period, I also had repeated, very dark self-destructive episodes. I drank to the point of blacking out. I don’t really remember most of 2017. I was on autopilot. In my everyday life, I tried to appear normal. I am not sure that anyone noticed how unwell I was because I tried to never let on. I was still operating as if I was fine. I was still covering, even to myself, even though I knew I needed help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of that year, I finally found a therapist and psychiatrist. By that point, I was what clinicians refer to as “in crisis” but I was still masking and covering, even with my therapist. It took a while to chip away at that, but they started by focusing on symptomatic relief which allowed me to get to a place where I could start healing. It was not easy. It was not fast. It has not been without obstacles. It is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you all of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want you to know that there are people in your lives who experience VERY severe forms of mental illness in ways that are completely invisible to you. You have friends, family, colleagues, instructors, acquaintances, etc. who are struggling and suffering around you, right now. Right this very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I want you to know, if you are someone who has experienced trauma, or experiences mental illness, and you feel like you are alone in this: &lt;em&gt;you are not alone.&lt;/em&gt; It seems cliche to say it this way, but it is true. There are so many people around you who understand and who struggle and suffer similarly. You are literally not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m telling you this because keeping quiet about it doesn’t help anyone. I am open about my experience with mental illness now. I talk publicly about it. I disclose it because I’ve come to the understanding that keeping it to myself didn’t help me. It didn’t help the people close to me who have succumbed to it and died from it. It doesn’t help anyone else who might be struggling around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed, increasingly, that students seem to feel like they have to disclose their trauma in order to receive the simplest grace, such as an extension on an assignment in class. We are operating in a system that encourages people who have power to not care. We have operationalized “fairness” as not caring about people’s lives and the things that they face. We have come to expect that, particularly at the university, we have to trade enormous trauma in order to receive even the smallest relief from constant pressure to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not worth it. None of this is worth it. None of it. We cannot learn in an environment like this. No learning takes place here. Just more trauma. All of this: these classes, the grades, the degrees, the honors, the awards, the recognition; it’s all for nothing if you can’t live through it. None of it, NONE of it, is worth your life, your health, your well-being. None of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not failing in a system like the one at this university. It is failing you. You deserve better. You deserve to be treated like people who have lives and face things that might get in the way. You deserve to be helped through them. You deserve to be taught ways to work through obstacles without sacrificing your well-being. You deserve to know that you are not alone and that there is help available. You deserve better than what you are currently experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is a choice. We have a choice. We could approach education from a place of care. We have collectively chosen otherwise. We’ve chosen to accept the most callous responses from administrators and many faculty in the face of gruelling adversity. We have spent the better part of the last two years surrounded by death and disease and we are expected to operate as if everything is fine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is not fine. And I’m not going to pretend like it is. What I am going to do is tell you that we will get through the rest of this semester. We will do it together. That is the only way through. This is a class about web development, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t also be a class about being human. Everything we do here should be about that, first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for this week, for right now, I want you to not worry about this class. I want you to not think about it. Just take a few days and think about anything else. Do something that makes you feel good, joyous, buoyant. On Thursday, we’ll meet live on Zoom and talk about regrouping and how the rest of the semester will go. In the meantime, if you are struggling, please reach out to me. I care about your well-being. I care about your success. I am not going to let you fail. I am not going to watch you struggle needlessly. You deserve better. We deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also encourage you to keep this number on hand: 1-800-273-8255. It is the number for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&quot;&gt;National Suicide Prevention Lifeline&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/&quot;&gt;chat function&lt;/a&gt; available if that is more comfortable than talking over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This number has helped me and has helped friends who were not able to talk to anyone around them at times. You don’t have to be in crisis to call. You don’t have to be actively experiencing suicidal thoughts or ideation. You can just call if you are struggling. The operators can direct you to other resources as well. Please share the number and link widely if you aren’t doing so already. Remind the people around you that there is help available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Thursday and beyond that: take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Push back against the callousness that has become our standard operating mode at the university. Be kind and patient, particularly with yourselves. You deserve this and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>I Want the World to Know</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;I love the idea of National Coming Out Day.&lt;/span&gt;  I always have. But a few things about it and my personal life experience make me think really deeply about it every year. I thought that it might be useful to share these thoughts. I consider most of what I&amp;#39;ve written below whenever I approach a group of people, particularly in the context of teaching and working in the academy. But all of this extends well beyond those boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Coming Out Day is something that I first encountered in college and I think that for many students it still provides a first opportunity to publicly say something unequivocal, brave, and affirming about themselves. There are those who believe that it is no longer relevant and we should stop celebrating it because in 2017 we are all safe now.&lt;label for='end' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='end' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Matthew H. Birkhold. 10 October 2017. It’s time to end National Coming Out Day. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/its-time-to-end-national-coming-out-day/2017/10/10/a9db94ec-ad2b-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html&quot;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/its-time-to-end-national-coming-out-day/2017/10/10/a9db94ec-ad2b-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; That is clearly incorrect. More on that later. For now, here are my thoughts on coming out of the closet and celebrating publicly the fact that I have done so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-dont-really-want-to-have-to-come-out&quot;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really want to have to come out.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want there to be a default position that I have to acknowledge I don&amp;#39;t fit into. I really just want to be left alone to live my life. That is, I think, what most queer people want: to simply be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advice about what to do when we come out: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t kill us. At a bare minimum, don&amp;#39;t kill us. Also, don&amp;#39;t discriminate against us at work. Or shun us from your social circles. Or stare at us. Or make us feel like we have to qualify our existence and explain it. Just... leave us be. And don&amp;#39;t make us come out, but let us do so if we want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-come-out-all-the-time&quot;&gt;I come out all the time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not quite true. I come out regularly. I come out a lot. I have come out hundreds, thousands, an endless number of times. I come out every day, at least once. I&amp;#39;m coming out right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do you know why? It&amp;#39;s not because I want everyone to know I&amp;#39;m queer and demand that they acknowledge it in my presence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the time I come out because I mention my husband/partner casually in conversation and that is when it occurs to someone that I am queer. Let&amp;#39;s make that a quarter of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quarter of the time, it is because someone mentions my wife offhand (I wear a wedding ring) and I&amp;#39;ll correct them. Or someone will ask about my girlfriend or if I have a girlfriend and I&amp;#39;ll correct them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I&amp;#39;m not pedantic about this. I just say, &amp;quot;Oh my husband, blah blah blah...&amp;quot; like nothing happened. I do this because I don&amp;#39;t want my interlocutor to be embarrassed or feel like they are putting me out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But guess what: &lt;em&gt;It puts me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I tend to use the word &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;husband.&amp;quot; I want other people to be able to talk about themselves. But I want them to do it without feeling ill-at-ease because I misgendered their partner. It&amp;#39;s also tactical, on another front, because I want it to signal to people that maybe we should be using non-gendered language about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-dont-come-out-all-the-time&quot;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t come out all the time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the time I don&amp;#39;t come out. I don&amp;#39;t say anything about myself. Or I straight up lie and misgender my own partner until I can leave the conversation and get away from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all self-preservative behavior. If someone misgenders my partner, and there are enough other cues, I know I&amp;#39;m not safe. If I hear someone using violent, queerphobic language, I know I&amp;#39;m not safe. I&amp;#39;m not coming out. If anyone specifically asks if I&amp;#39;m gay: I&amp;#39;m not coming out. If I hear someone speculate about someone else being LGBTQIA: I&amp;#39;m not coming out. I&amp;#39;m also ending the conversation and leaving it as soon as possible. I don&amp;#39;t need to be around all of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-preservation is first. Everything else is second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-let-someone-elses-behavior-affect-me&quot;&gt;Why do I let someone else&amp;#39;s behavior affect me?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember two structural features of our social worlds when we talk about how great coming out is and wish each other happy National Coming Out Day: it is impossible for some people to come out, and impractical for others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a number of years living in the Middle East. I was not out then. I lived with my partner. That was difficult. We were &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;roommates&amp;quot; most of the time. Some of our friends knew, most did not. It was always uncomfortable. It has taken me six years since moving back to the United States to feel comfortable talking publicly about being queer. It has taken me &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; to return to being comfortable talking about myself because I spent all those years constantly on guard about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I had &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; problem talking about it. I was in queer student groups. I worked for an LGBTQ support office. I talked to classes about being queer. I helped found Kalamazoo Pride. But it was impractical to be out for a certain period, so I went back in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loads of people do this all the time. We collectively force them into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; settings, straight people talk about their wives and husbands and kids and personal lives all the time. But the whole mood changes when a queer person does the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-behavior-may-signal-to-us-that-were-not-safe&quot;&gt;Your behavior may signal to us that we&amp;#39;re not safe.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that happens, we don&amp;#39;t talk about ourselves. People ask if we&amp;#39;re married: we demur. We change the conversation. We leave the room. We also leave the profession/the academy/our jobs/our careers/public spaces, etc. You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have lots of reasons, both situational and structural, for not being out: and they are all good reasons. Don&amp;#39;t ever expect someone to put themselves at risk like that. And don&amp;#39;t you dare out people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, don&amp;#39;t think that the world no longer needs days like this when queer people can make themselves visible if they so choose. We still do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you think the world is ready for us all to be who we are doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it is. Give people space to just be people. Leave them alone. Let them be. Be happy for those who are out on National Coming Out Day. But remember that it&amp;#39;s also okay not to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for='tweets' class='margin-toggle'&gt; &amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='tweets' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='marginnote'&gt;This blog post came out of my tweeting about National Coming Out Day this morning after I saw the usual mix of things in the news and on Twitter about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No one cares whose fault it is</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;On Monday, The Daily Tar Heel published&lt;/span&gt;  a misguided and poorly-reasoned op-ed by way of apologetic for Carol Folt, Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;label for='fault' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='fault' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Editorial Board. 27 August, 2017. It’s not all Folt&amp;#39;s fault. &lt;em&gt;The Daily Tar Heel.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/08/edit-2-0828&quot;&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/08/edit-2-0828&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The editorial argued that anger over the continued existence of UNC&amp;#39;s Confederate monument in McCorkle Place&amp;mdash;commonly known as Silent Sam&amp;mdash;is misplaced. This opinion is premised on the notion that most of this anger has fallen on the Chancellor because of her &amp;quot;prominent position&amp;quot; and that she should be &amp;quot;respected for her strong leadership&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dedication&amp;quot; to ensuring UNC&amp;#39;s continued smooth operation. The editorial tediously and pedantically explained that because UNC is a massive bureaucracy, it&amp;#39;s leader has no real power. This was followed by praise for Chancellor Folt&amp;#39;s efforts at getting donors to cough up cash to fill UNC&amp;#39;s coffers in the face of dwindling funding from the NC General Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chancellor is not a glorified development officer or ceremonial figurehead. The person presently inhabiting this role leads a major university faced with a very specific set of problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that Chancellor Folt is the target of anger and criticism is not &amp;quot;her prominent position at UNC.&amp;quot; Leadership roles are necessarily prominent: the word means to be out front of something. People are angry with her right now because she was hired and chose to take on the role of leader in this community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading a community is not a position of glory and great stature, it is a position of humility and service. Most do not treat it like this. Chancellor Folt deserves no respect except as a result of her actions as our leader. And presently she is failing on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Folt co-signed a letter with President Spellings and other UNC officials, requesting that the Governor&amp;#39;s office do something about Silent Sam. Governor Cooper assented.&lt;label for='permission' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='permission' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Ana Irizarry. 21 August, 2017. Cooper gives UNC permission to remove Silent Sam. &lt;em&gt;The Daily Tar Heel.&lt;/em&gt; Retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/08/silent-sam-letter&quot;&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/08/silent-sam-letter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;  This was in the face of Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger&amp;#39;s quite insightful proposal of a plan to remove Silent Sam even in the face of standing legislation.&lt;label for='letter' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='letter' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Pam Hemminger. 18 August, 2017.

UNC Chancellor Carol Folt’s baffling stand on Silent Sam. &lt;em&gt;The News and Observer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article169000337.html&quot;&gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article169000337.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; And there is real risk to public safety, and in particular, the safety of the campus community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When white supremacists show up on campus in protest of students conducting a sit-in as they did this weekend, it is a risk to public safety. This argument is met with free speech absolutism by Chancellor Folt and the army of public relations professionals propping her up. But this is not about free speech. White supremacists marching onto UNC&amp;#39;s campus should not be waived away as just another demonstration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people subscribed to this ideology do not believe in the humanity of people of color. They believe similarly about queer and disabled people. They believe that a portion of the UNC community simply doesn&amp;#39;t belong here, and that the best course of action is to remove them, by violence, if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for='spencer' class='margin-toggle'&gt; &amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='spencer' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='marginnote'&gt;Just in case anyone thinks that I am not paying attention, I have to acknowledge that Chancellor Folt cited safety concerns ni deciding to deny a request by Richard Spencer, of &amp;quot;punch a nazi&amp;quot; fame, to speak on campus this week. This decision was 1) made at the 11th hour, 2) a token gesture, 3) happened the day before she busted up a peaceful protest against a white supremacist monument. There is no way that this looks good for the university or makes up for the rest of missteps made by its administration in not harshly condemning white supremacists as having no place on a university campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camila Molina. 30 August, 2017. UNC chancellor denies white nationalist Richard Spencer’s request to speak at campus. &lt;em&gt;The News and Observer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article170243417.html&quot;&gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article170243417.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The myth of white supremacy is an incitement to violence against the most vulnerable members of this community.
And Silent Sam is the lightning rod for that violence on UNC&amp;#39;s campus. They will continue to come. They will continue to threaten violence. And these threats are not idle. They are insidious, seething, and constant. We become accustomed to them, and forget that they are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tiki torch found near &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/silentsam?src=hash&quot;&gt;#silentsam&lt;/a&gt; protest at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unc?src=hash&quot;&gt;#unc&lt;/a&gt; calls back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/charlottesville?src=hash&quot;&gt;#charlottesville&lt;/a&gt; violence. Police don&amp;#39;t keep us safe, community must respond. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mr99mJJlxc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mr99mJJlxc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Daniel Hosterman (@dhosterman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhosterman/status/901866898387816448&quot;&gt;August 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any argument that the sit-in is attracting all of this is the wrong argument. The current sit-in at Silent Sam is exactly the free speech that we should be protecting. The white supremacist response to it is violence. That violence is directly targeting the protesters, and no-so-indirectly targeting the most vulnerable and marginalized people at UNC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While UNC might be an enormous bureaucracy with competing interests from stakeholders for Chancellor Folt to balance, she can still speak. And she has repeatedly advocated the kind of free speech absolutism which allows white supremacist incitement to violence to go unchecked.
She has, at no point, said publicly that she supports the removal of Silent Sam. This omission is deafening at UNC, and she knows that. But in the interest of toadying for the NC GOP and the General Assembly, she remains silent, in the face of such monuments coming down around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That silence tells a lot of us that we do not belong at UNC. We are not a valid part of this community, but white supremacists are. The additional knowledge that Governor Cooper has signed off on the removal of Silent Sam to protect public safety tells us something else. It says that Chancellor Folt does not consider violence directed at marginalized people at UNC to be a threat to public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning, as the week rounded to a close, UNC administrators and police busted up the ongoing sit-in at Silent Sam.&lt;label for='busted' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='busted' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Jonathan Drew. 31 August, 2017. Protesters vow continued activism after UNC clears sit-in. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/protesters-vow-to-continue-sit-in-after-unc-clears-site/2017/08/31/d63970e8-8e5b-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html&quot;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/protesters-vow-to-continue-sit-in-after-unc-clears-site/2017/08/31/d63970e8-8e5b-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Now, keep in mind that this sit-in was completely non-violent, but has been threatened repeatedly with violence. For over a week, students organized material support for the sit-in, gathering food, water, power packs, and temporary shelter around Silent Sam. Administrators and campus police carted all of this away, along with the protesters&amp;#39; signs and banners. The Chancellor had already previously banned tents and confiscated any that had been placed at the site, citing safety concerns. The taking of the signs and banners should be viewed as an unconstitutional stifling of free speech on the part of a government entity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;UNC police just took all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silentsamsitin&quot;&gt;@silentsamsitin&lt;/a&gt; tables, posters, and items. Students are staying strong in solidarity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SilenceSam?src=hash&quot;&gt;#SilenceSam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/40o1jIC8p8&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/40o1jIC8p8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Heather (@HeatherHboro) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HeatherHboro/status/903249556233744386&quot;&gt;August 31, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why did this happen? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university made no public statement about the motivations for busting up the sit-in. That would give people something to argue against. This tactic allows people to think that the sit-in protesters had done something to provoke this response, which they had not. My reasoned assertion is that Chancellor Folt decided to clear out McCorkle place of protesters because the first home football game of the season was coming up in just a few days and her public relations team did not like the optics of well-supported ongoing sit-in protest happening right in the main path Carolina football fans take from Franklin St. to Kenan Memorial Stadium. It&amp;#39;s a fair bet that a great many of those fans are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fans of removing a Confederate monument from UNC&amp;#39;s campus. Universities care what their football fans think, because, we are told, their enthusiasm for sport converts readily into donations to the university.&lt;label for='football' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='football' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Camila Molina and Ray Gronberg. 2017. Countdown to kickoff? UNC cleans up Silent Sam protest. &lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/orange-county/article170417367.html&quot;&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/orange-county/article170417367.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the leader of a major university is dismissing the well-being of marginalized members of the community she serves so that football fans would not have to see the ugly history of the university laid bare. And still, she says nothing on the matter.&lt;label for='silent' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='silent' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Editorial Board. 1 September, 2017. More souring on Sam, but where is Folt? &lt;em&gt;The News and Observer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article170800582.html&quot;&gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article170800582.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not all be Folt&amp;#39;s fault. But fault is not the reason that people are angry: inaction is. Given the continued mishandling of this situation, the UNC community should call for the Chancellor&amp;#39;s resignation. Then perhaps we can find a Chancellor who will serve this community by putting its safety and well-being before PR concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unsolicited advice for new PhD students</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;I used this Tweet&lt;/span&gt;  as my morning writing prompt a few weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for='thread' class='margin-toggle'&gt; &amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='thread' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='marginnote'&gt;My tweet thread on this topic is located here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdmar3/status/896063276726886400&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/jdmar3/status/896063276726886400&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Earned a PhD? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pay it forward &amp;amp; help the next generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is your most important advice for a new PhD student?&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdtips?src=hash&quot;&gt;#phdtips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Prof Dynarski (@dynarski) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dynarski/status/895690052616978432&quot;&gt;August 10, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is my advice for new PhD students. Some of these are things that I did and benefited me. Others are things that I wish I had done or wish I had figured out earlier. They are obviously not intended to be universal, but maybe someone else will benefit from the distillation of my experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a reference manager that you like and stick with it. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;paperpile.com&quot;&gt;Paperpile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to write in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdowntutorial.com/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub style=&quot;vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X / L&lt;sup style=&quot;font-size: 0.85em; vertical-align: 0.15em; margin-left: -0.36em; margin-right: -0.15em;&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub style=&quot;vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;, and stop using M$Word.&lt;label for='' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Charlie Stross. 2013.

Just stop using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write every single day. Write something, anything every morning and just squirrel it away for later.&lt;label for='fifteen-minutes' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='fifteen-minutes' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Alison Miller. 2007.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find friends/colleagues to write/work with on a regular basis.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write seminar papers with the aim of publishing them.&lt;label for='publish' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='publish' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Stacey Patton. 2013.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t compare your progress to that of your compatriots and cohort.&lt;label for='compare' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='compare' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Deborah Carr. 2015. 3 Reasons to Stop Comparing Yourself to Others.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to use version control software and a remote repository to manage your work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; are both awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=077187625891&quot;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; to write. It is good for collaboration, versioning, and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DO NOT STORE DATA OR WRITING ON YOUR LAPTOP. Keep it multiply backed up, in a cloud app, and/or a remote server.&lt;label for='backup' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='backup' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Gabe Tippery. 2014.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a therapist (and maybe a Psych MD) early on.

Do not allow it to go untreated. Talk therapy can help. Do not be averse to medication. Caring for your mental health is not a sign of weakness. [Extending this advice: if you suffer from anxiety, depression, or other mental illness, talk to your university&amp;#39;s disabled student services office. These offices exist in order to ensure that the university is at least complying with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm&quot;&gt;ADA rules&lt;/a&gt;. They can and will help you a great deal.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go outside for an extended period every day. Just sit outside and read or take a walk. Listen to the sounds of birds and cicadas and running water. It will make you feel more human and reduce your stress levels.&lt;label for='nature' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='nature' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;University of Sussex. 2017.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I need a baker&amp;#39;s dozen here, so I&amp;#39;ll leave this as the last one: do something nice for yourself every day. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a big thing. Buy yourself a coffee and pastry; cook something you really like; take yourself out for lunch or a cocktail (like my dog, I am really food-motivated); read a trashy sci-fi novel; watch an episode (ONE EPISODE, not 10 episodes) of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Star Trek; etc. It helps you get away from your dissertation or coursework, and it can remind you that you are more than your PhD.&lt;label for='more' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='more' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Laura Harrison. 2015.

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million such things that I could write. I am missing a lot here. Here is a piece of advice from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savasavasava&quot;&gt;@savasavasava&lt;/a&gt; that I found to be very good: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;(find a person or persons outside your department/school who will give you straight, no nonsense encouragement/advice.)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; dr. sava (@savasavasava) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savasavasava/status/901160999780327425&quot;&gt;August 25, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was particularly important for me. I have leaned heavily on the advice and encouragement given to me by several mentors outside of my university/department/field throughout the PhD. Without them, I would not be able to do this. So, make friends and find mentors outside. It helps give you a more expansive view of the world and reminds you that there is more out there than just you, alone, slogging away at your dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Affirmative action is not the problem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;The US Department of Justice,&lt;/span&gt;  under directive from the Trump administration, is going to pursue an investigation of affirmative action as a form of race-based discrimination.&lt;label for='doj' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='doj' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Savage, Charlie. 1 August 2017. &amp;quot;Justice Dept. to Take On Affirmative Action in College Admissions.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-affirmative-action-universities.html&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-affirmative-action-universities.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
This raised a few questions for me, as it should have for many people in higher ed. 
This can be settled with a straw poll:&lt;label for='tweet' class='margin-toggle'&gt; &amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='tweet' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='marginnote'&gt;This blog post was inspired by some tweets I made on this topic. Given the importance of the topic, I thought it deserved longer, more coherent treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you teach or have taught a class at a  university, raise your hand if you&amp;#39;ve taught a class with only white students.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John D. Martin III (@jdmar3) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdmar3/status/892735411218513920&quot;&gt;August 2, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you teach or have taught a class at a  university, raise your hand if you&amp;#39;ve taught a class with only white students. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ast;raises own hand&amp;ast;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now raise your hand if you&amp;#39;ve ever taught a class with only black students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a class with only indigenous/native American students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a class with all Latinx students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you teach at a university in the United States that isn&amp;#39;t an HBCU, then you have likely experienced one of the above scenarios: and it&amp;#39;s not the last three. 
In my experience teaching, I have never had a class in which students of color comprised more than 20% of the roster. 
I was a TA in several undergraduate Arabic literature and Islamic studies courses at the American University in Cairo made up of exclusively Egyptian students. 
But we were at a university in Cairo, and the classes were in Arabic. 
So that is a slightly different scenario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of white students being discriminated against by universities is quite simply not a problem. 
It doesn&amp;#39;t exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the opposite &amp;mdash;the problem of students of color not being admitted or not applying to universities&amp;mdash;absolutely still exists, despite affirmative action. 
Banning or removing affirmative action programs makes the problem even worse.
Application rates for students of color go down subsequent to affirmative action bans.&lt;label for='admissions' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='admissions' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Dickson, Lisa M. 2006. “Does Ending Affirmative Action in College Admissions Lower the Percent of Minority Students Applying to College?” Economics of Education Review 25 (1): 109–19. doi:&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.11.005&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.11.005&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;
Graduation rates for students of color suffer tremendously as a result of the removal of affirmative action programs.&lt;label for='graduation' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='graduation' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Cortes, Kalena E. 2010. “Do Bans on Affirmative Action Hurt Minority Students? Evidence from the Texas Top 10% Plan.” Economics of Education Review 29 (6): 1110–24. doi:&lt;a href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~cortesk/econed2010.pdf&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.econedurev.2010.06.004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt; 
These problems are &lt;em&gt;even worse&lt;/em&gt; at highly &amp;quot;selective&amp;quot; or elite universities.&lt;label for='problems' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='problems' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Hinrichs, Peter. 2010. “The Effects of Affirmative Action Bans on College Enrollment, Educational Attainment, and the Demographic Composition of Universities.” The Review of Economics and Statistics 94 (3): 712–22. doi:&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00170&quot;&gt;10.1162/REST_a_00170&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that the intent and purpose of affirmative action is to keep white people out of universities, let me say a few things to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not working. There is an embarrassing number of white students at universities and students of color still have trouble getting into, paying for, and graduating from university.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe that affirmative action means taking something away from a white person, you are a white supremacist. This is unequivocal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. universities are (sometimes literally) built on a foundation of white supremacism. To argue otherwise is deluded and intellectually dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White students have every single advantage available to them when it comes to university admission, including legacy preference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, many white people apparently erroneously believe that people of color have a free-ride to college in the United States. 
This is not only false, but patently absurd. 
Enslaved black people were exploited to build many unversities in the United States. 
Despite this reality, no reparations are being made to their descendents.&lt;label for='slave-universities' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='slave-universities' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Love, David. 21 April 2016. &amp;quot;Enslaved Black People Helped Build America’s Top Universities — How Should the Colleges Right These Wrongs?.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Black Star.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/04/21/enslaved-black-people-helped-build-americas-top-universities-how-should-the-colleges-right-these-wrongs/&quot;&gt;http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/04/21/enslaved-black-people-helped-build-americas-top-universities-how-should-the-colleges-right-these-wrongs/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The notion that free college is afforded to black Americans is a delusion: a white supremacist fantasy meant to stoke feelings of entitlment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do you know how many white people truly and genuinely believe that black people get to go to college for free?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ashley C. Ford (@iSmashFizzle) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle/status/892557827675480064&quot;&gt;August 2, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All such thinking is premised on the notion that white people and their children deserve to be given something that people of color must work for (or flat-out do not deserve). 
This notion usually takes the form of discussions about &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;readiness&amp;quot; of minority students. 
These words are all codes for underlying delusional white supremacist ideologies that white people take for granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lawsuits about affirmative action come back around every few years, allowing the casual white supremacist contingent in the United States to clutch their pearls about non-existent discrimination against them.
And each time, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that affirmative is not in any way unconstitutional, and it has remained legal.&lt;label for='justice' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='justice' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;Ifill, Sherrilyn A. 2 August 2017. &amp;quot;Racial Justice Demands Affirmative Action.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/college-discrimination-whites-donald-trump-.html&quot;&gt;https://nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/college-discrimination-whites-donald-trump-.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
The repeated legal challenges to affirmative action are meant to normalize the insidious discourse of reverse discrimination (which simply does not and cannot exist in a structurally unequal system). 
It is very dangerous, however, that this repeated white supremacist push for challenging affirmative action has reached the Department of Justice and might result in federal investigations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is especially important for white people in the United States to reject this discussion as illegitimate. 
It is our responsibility to shut the conversation down when we hear our friends and family making absurd, incorrect, and unsupported claims about the relationship between race, higher education, and affirmative action. 
Be prepared to get uncomfortable. 
Be prepared to be the buzzkill in the room when the topic of conversation turns in this direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t, you&amp;#39;re the problem, not the solution. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Onion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;If you are wondering why the little onion icon&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;icnf-tor&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t link you anywhere, look no further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that this link is not like other links: &lt;a href=&quot;http://evpoyeb3anapeyrt.onion&quot; class=&quot;icnf-tor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://evpoyeb3anapeyrt.onion&quot;&gt;http://evpoyeb3anapeyrt.onion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; is not actually a Top-Level Domain (TLD) in the normal Dynamic Name Service (DNS). 
It only works if you are using Tor to access the Internet. 
Tor allows for the configuration of hidden services that get advertised only on the Tor network. 
These services allow for the dissemination of information or connections services like ssh or ftp over an encrypted, untraceable route. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use that or any link ending in &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt;, you need to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&quot;&gt;Tor Browser Bundle&lt;/a&gt; and run it. 
You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/docs/installguide.html.en&quot;&gt;install Tor&lt;/a&gt; and configure a proxy on your system, but it is more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also run Tor on a smartphone. 
Android has a client called &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make another post about how I set up the &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; version of this site &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GalliumOS on Chromebook</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;I have had a Chromebook for a few years&lt;/span&gt;  and have always wanted to put a real Linux distribution on it. 
This weekend my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hauspoor&quot;&gt;Elliott Hauser&lt;/a&gt; showed me &lt;a href=&quot;https://galliumos.org/&quot;&gt;GalliumOS&lt;/a&gt;, which is being developed as a full but lightweight GNU/Linux distribution for Chromebooks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This desire to have real Linux on my Chromebook was recently rekindled while working with students to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kali.org/&quot;&gt;Kali Linux&lt;/a&gt; so that we can work on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnuradio.org/&quot;&gt;GNURadio&lt;/a&gt; project in &lt;a href=&quot;https://inls718.johndmart.in&quot;&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. 
I wanted to install Kali on the Lenovo N20P that I have been carrying everywhere for the last 2+ years, and so I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton&quot;&gt;Crouton&lt;/a&gt;, since it has Kali as one of the available distributions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t get it to actually start the desktop environment, though. 
It would take the start command and then go to blank screen and then do nothing past that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;chrx&quot;&gt;CHRX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this to Elliott and he suggested using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reynhout/chrx&quot;&gt;CHRX&lt;/a&gt; to set up a real dual-boot instead of Crouton, which just places another Linux chroot inside ChromeOS. 
Kali Linux was not one of the install options, but GalliumOS 
I played around with it on one of his devices and was pretty impressed. 
It had all the packages I need to run GNURadio with SDR devices, so I decided to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the instructions available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing&quot;&gt;GalliumOS wiki&lt;/a&gt; for my hardware (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Baytrail&quot;&gt;Intel Baytrail&lt;/a&gt;), which requires a firmware update before the install can begin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should add that the Chromebook was already in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Preparing&quot;&gt;developer mode&lt;/a&gt; before I began. 
The GalliumOS involved downloading and running the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrx.org/#usage&quot;&gt;install script&lt;/a&gt; once to update the firmware and install the legacy bootloader.&lt;label for='warning' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='checkbox' id='warning' class='margin-toggle'/&gt;&lt;span class='sidenote'&gt;It is really important to actually look at and understand the scripts that you are downloading before you run them using sudo. The method on the CHRX page uses several commands strung together which download and then run the script without pausing. It is better to download the script first and then run it, in my opinion, but everyone makes their own choices. &lt;/span&gt; 
This powerwashes and &amp;quot;repairs&amp;quot; the Chromebook to repartition the SSD.
Then, after a reboot, downloading and running the same script. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I allocated the maximum available space to GalliumOS, because I&amp;#39;m not going to use ChromeOS much if at all at this point. 
I&amp;#39;ll probably eventually just remove that partition altogether. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;touchscreen&quot;&gt;Touchscreen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The touchscreen on the N20P worked out of the box with GalliumOS, but I noticed that it failed to respond after I closed and reopened the lid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some poking around, I figured out that the there was something happening with the kernel module for the touchscreen that made it fail after a lid close suspend. 
It comes back just fine after a suspend from the interface, but if the lid is closed, then the touchscreen doesn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get it working once again once out of suspend by opening a terminal and reloading the &lt;code&gt;atmel_mxt_ts&lt;/code&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo rmmod atmel_mxt_ts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo modprobe atmel_mxt_ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid having to do that myself every time. I added a script (as root) to &lt;code&gt;/lib/systemd/system-sleep/&lt;/code&gt; that reloads the module after the system comes back from suspend triggered by lid closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchscreen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This will reload the atmel_mxt_ts module after suspension from lid close &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# so that the touchscreen will function.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;suspend&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hybrid-sleep&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
    case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in
        &lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; /sbin/rmmod atmel_mxt_ts &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; /sbin/modprobe atmel_mxt_ts &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;esac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hack, and there is likely a better way to do this, but it works now, so I&amp;#39;m sated for the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can install GNURadio and play with Software Defined Radio (SDR) on my Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching soft skills</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='newthought'&gt;Lisa Hinchliffe (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lisalibrarian&quot;&gt;@lisalibrarian&lt;/a&gt;) tweeted this morning&lt;/span&gt;  about training and hiring for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; skills rather than just technical skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Training and hiring for all the skills not just technical ones.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4SEJGL4eMx&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4SEJGL4eMx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lisa Hinchliffe (@lisalibrarian) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lisalibrarian/status/826770553839161344&quot;&gt;February 1, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@thisissethsblog/lets-stop-calling-them-soft-skills-9cc27ec09ecb#.hjltmp5pz&quot;&gt;linked article&lt;/a&gt; by Seth Godin: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we’ve confirmed that vocational skills can be taught (you’re not born knowing engineering or copywriting or even graphic design, therefore they must be something we can teach), while we let ourselves off the hook when it comes to decision making, eager participation, dancing with fear, speaking with authority, working in teams, seeing the truth, speaking the truth, inspiring others, doing more than we’re asked, caring and being willing to change things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brought back some thoughts I&amp;#39;ve had recently about students&amp;#39; expectations in some of the courses that I&amp;#39;ve taught. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want a lot of information about what will be done up front. 
They want to be taught specific technical skills so they can put them on a resume. 
They want to have a path laid out before them and be able to go along it, checking the boxes as they go.
They want to do work and receive a grade and get a degree and get a job, and so on. 
Of course, not all students want this, but we have structured our institutions such that they often expect these things from us as instructors, whether any of us knows that is happening or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the world doesn&amp;#39;t really work like this. 
We usually have to find our own way through, and no set of technical skills will help with that without the second half of Seth Godin&amp;#39;s list above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not teaching (or encouraged to teach) how to work through problems, how to collaborate, or how to figure out what skills you need and then go about getting them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-alternative-approach&quot;&gt;An alternative approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am teaching a user interface design class this semester. 
I decided to experiment and try to overtly teach &amp;quot;soft skills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of lecturing from a bunch of readings and teaching them technical skills, the whole course is organized around planning and executing a single semester-long project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week we discussed collaboration and social design, and then had a comprehensive crash course on using GitHub by my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hauspoor&quot;&gt;Elliott Hauser&lt;/a&gt;.
The 2nd week, we talked about the complexity of the design process, and then collectively used a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-charrettes/&quot;&gt;design charrette&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; to come up with a plan.
This week, we discussed ways to research users, and then will start making user profiles on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesdays are discussion days for which there are assigned topical readings. 
This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that discussion days are not interactive. 
Yesterday, we watched the first 15 minutes of Alfred Hitchcock&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Read Window&lt;/em&gt; (1954) and critiqued it as an example of how deliberate choices can be made to craft an experience that will be different for each indivisual viewer (user) but will engage them all in similar or overlapping ways. 
One student pointed out that the window shades going up during the opening credits was like a progress bar.
It subtly told the viewer when the credits would be over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity was inspired by Luke Miller&amp;#39;s mention of the film in the opening chapter of his book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Practitioners-Guide-User-Experience-Design/dp/1455548588&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Practitioner&amp;#39;s Guide to User Experience Design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
It led to a good discussion about ways we might understand different users perspectives, needs, and expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursdays are work days during which we actually do some part of the project all in the same space together.
This week, we will have a live demo of the platform that is the focus of the project. 
Students are going to get to interact with hardware and actually try out an existing software environment. 
More on that later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Elliott&amp;#39;s GitHub tutorial, everyone got to create files, make commits, and create pull requests. 
We also learned about using GitHub&amp;#39;s social layer to coordinate and assign tasks to individual developers of groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the design charrette, they self-organized into teams based on what they were skilled at and interested in learning more about.
The teams are things like: programming, visual design, interaction design, branding, documentation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this process, and throughout the course, we&amp;#39;re going to continue discussing collaboration, workflow management, leadership, organizational skills.
My aim is to have them become comfortable with many of the aspects of large team project management that they would not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;everyone-works-together&quot;&gt;Everyone works together&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have had all of them select a project and do a critique and redesign. 
I have 20 students.
This would have been an immense amount of work for me as the instructor and the focus of evaulation would be on the content of their projects, rather than on how to work and think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this approach, they will learn to work through development with a large team AND on a real project. I recruited a &amp;quot;resident entrepreneur&amp;quot; for the class: Erica Young, founder of Raleigh Dynamics, a startup specializing in amplifier hardware.
She is an electronics engineer who is working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio&quot;&gt;Software Defined Radio&lt;/a&gt; (SDR) and wants to expand the market for these devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDR is &lt;em&gt;HARD&lt;/em&gt; for novice users. 
The project for this course is to design and build a plugin for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnuradio.org/&quot;&gt;GNURadio&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source SDR programming environment.
The aim for the plugin is to walk users through setting up an SDR using direct manipulation and showing users how one setting affects the others.
The most difficult part about using an SDR is understanding the tradeoffs when selecting setting and building a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about all of this is that none of the students have any experience with this.
So like most UX projects, an engineer came to them with a bunch of requirements, requests, and desiderata in a completely unfamiliar space.
They will collectively, collaboratively work their way through the process. 
I&amp;#39;m just there to facilitate that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the grading for the class is related to what they do for the project, but rather how they do it. 
It&amp;#39;s all self- and peer-evaluation.
My aim is to create a design team instead of a class, which then makes the course about working on a design team, linking back to theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;will-it-work&quot;&gt;Will it work?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope it works. 
It&amp;#39;s going well so far. 
It&amp;#39;s a little scary (for both me and students) to have such a wide open plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is what the world is actually like. No one spoon feeds you in real design projects. You just have to dive in.
I&amp;#39;m just trying to make sure that we all dive into the deep end AND keep swimming once we&amp;#39;re there.
The best part is that students are responding by showing up with ideas, suggestions, plans and they are not afraid to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re only really in the third week. 
I can&amp;#39;t wait to see what they do by the end of the course. 
It&amp;#39;s going to be interesting, regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was inspired by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdmar3/status/826795277189337089&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
