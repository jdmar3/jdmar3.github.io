- Have you ever wondered why your word processor looks like a piece of paper rolling up and down on your screen? 
- Why are icons shaped like objects that we haven't used in over two decades?
- Do data structures sufficiently reflect reality?
- Why do we talk about "scrolling?"

The tools that we use on a daily basis have an underlying epistemology integrated into their form, structure, and intended funtion. 
This tends to be the epistemology of the person or persons who envisioned them and brought them into existence. 
Sometimes, as with scrolling, we are looking at a long cultural history continued through technological means. 

However, these tools and interfaces also both obscure information and manipulate users into making choices that they might not otherwise make.{sidenote 'tech-hijacks' 'Harris, Tristan. “How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist.” Medium.

## Hidden functions and features

Modern interfaces attempt to make information processing and handling easier through presenting users with familar shapes and manipulation pathways. 
These interfaces presume that users will recognize the shapes and pathways they are presented with which means that they do not particularly account for idiomatic features that do not map cross-culturally. 
More than exhibiting cross-cultural differences, interface features embody specific cultural and linguistic orientations that make them universally inaccessible. 

In my summer class,{% marginnote 'inls161-link' '*[Tools for Information Literacy](http://inls161.johndmart.in):* this course covers concepts of information literacy and tools for creating, formatting, manipulating, and disseminating information.' %} I aim to give students a platform through which they can develop high quality documentation &mdash; both on- and offline &mdash; and materials for presentation. 
The course also introduces students to some basic aspects of how computing and networking work, as well some basic aspects of handling data. 
It is an introductory course, and fulfills a technology requirement, but when I was given the assignment last year, I felt like it needed to be updated considerably to incorporate some new skillsets that .{% marginnote 'acknowledgements' 'I would like to point out here that my reaction to the design of the course as it stood when I inherited it is related to changes in technology over the last two decades. The course was originally taught by Barbara Wildemuth, who also taught it to SILS faculty in the early days of personal computing. Ron Bergquist, who taught the course for many years, believed as well that it was time for an update and supported my efforts heartily.' %}
Originally focusing mainly on using productivity suite tools to a high degree of skill, I saw the opportunity to connect the course to some other areas of computing that might serve fledgling information professionals interacting with technology as sometimes programmers, sometimes users. 

Instead of focusing on productivity tools, I made the decision to design the course thinking about workflow, rather than interface. 
Toolchains, or the specific series of programs and commands that would take a user from source to completion of a given task or series of tasks. 
I made a few choices about this aproach that reflect my own values related to the relative simplicity and complexity of interfaces. 
In my worldview, an interface should only be as complex as it needs to be, and no more. 
It should not obscure anything, either, meaning that I prefer interfaces that have a high degree of transparency with regard to what is going on underneath. 
I also prefer, with great zeal, to use open source software tools whenever possible. 

For this course, I decided that our workflow would stick to command-line interfaecs wherever possible and that we would begin with plaintext and work our way up to finished, formatted polished outputs that were nearly universally accessible. 
This also afforded me the opportunity to introduce version control as a part of the workflow, because plaintext can be easily tracked through tools like Git on platforms like GitHub.
