In my summer class,{% marginnote 'inls161-link' '*[Tools for Information Literacy](http://inls161.johndmart.in):* this course covers concepts of information literacy and tools for creating, formatting, manipulating, and disseminating information.' %} I aim to give students a platform through which they can develop high quality documentation &mdash; both on- and offline &mdash; and materials for presentation. 
The course also introduces students to some basic aspects of how computing and networking work, as well some basic aspects of handling data. 
It is an introductory course, and fulfills a technology requirement, but when I was given the assignment last year, I felt like it needed to be updated considerably to incorporate some new skillsets that would benefit students as they proceeded through their degrees and onto the job market.{% marginnote 'acknowledgements' 'I would like to point out here that my reaction to the design of the course as it stood when I inherited it is related to changes in technology over the last two decades. The course was originally taught by Barbara Wildemuth, who also taught it to SILS faculty in the early days of personal computing. Ron Bergquist, who taught the course for many years, believed as well that it was time for an update and supported my efforts heartily.' %}

Originally focusing mainly on using productivity suite tools, I saw the opportunity to connect the course to some other areas of computing that might serve fledgling information professionals interacting with technology as sometimes programmers, sometimes users. 
Instead of focusing on productivity tools, I made the decision to design the course thinking about workflow, rather than interface. 
Toolchains, or the specific series of programs and commands that would take a user from source to completion of a given task or series of tasks. 

In a second round of preparing to teach the course, I have taken the opportunity to incorporate a good deal more discussion of the underlying epistemology of the tools that we use. 
It is important to try to understand what went into the design of the tools that we use, in part because it better allows us to utilize them and in part because it allows us to consider whether they are appropriate for our purposes in the first place.
Some tools, like a hammer, present users with an obvious set of options and are apparent about the tasks for which they are appropriate. 
Other tools are less transparent about the options available to a user and it is sometimes difficult to know what the intended purposes even are, like a 

I made a few choices about this aproach that reflect my own values related to the relative simplicity and complexity of interfaces. 
In my worldview, an interface should only be as complex as it needs to be, and no more. 
It should not obscure anything, either, meaning that I prefer interfaces that have a high degree of transparency with regard to what is going on underneath. 
I also prefer, with great zeal, to use open source software tools whenever possible. 

Below, I offer the rationale behind those choices. 

## Your experiences are not universal

{% newthought 'Modern interfaces attempt' %} to make information processing and handling easier through presenting users with familar shapes and manipulation pathways. 
These interfaces presume that users will recognize the shapes and pathways they are presented with. 
Interfaces are not typically designed for universal access, even if that is the intent of the designers. 
Designers and engineers are limited in their design choices by their experience and knowledge of the world around them.
This means that interfaces do not particularly account for idiomatic features that do not map cross-culturally or even between different segments of a given culture.

## Hidden functions and features

More than exhibiting cross-cultural differences, interface features embody specific cultural and linguistic orientations that might make them largely inaccessible. 
If a user encounters something that is incongruent with their experience or expectation, it may result in 

The tools that we use on a daily basis have an underlying epistemology integrated into their form, structure, and intended function. 
This tends to be the epistemology of the person or persons who envisioned them and brought them into existence. 
Sometimes, as with scrolling, we are looking at a long cultural history continued through technological means. 

However, these tools and interfaces also both obscure information and manipulate users into making choices that they might not otherwise make.{sidenote 'tech-hijacks' 'Harris, Tristan. “How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist.” Medium. Accessed June 6, 2016. https://medium.com/swlh/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3.'}

For this course, I decided that our workflow would stick to command-line interfaecs wherever possible and that we would begin with plaintext and work our way up to finished, formatted polished outputs that were nearly universally accessible. 
This also afforded me the opportunity to introduce version control as a part of the workflow, because plaintext can be easily tracked through tools like Git on platforms like GitHub. 






## Skeumorphism

- Have you ever wondered why your word processor looks like a piece of paper rolling up and down on your screen? 
- Why do we talk about "scrolling?"
- Why are icons shaped like objects that we haven't used in over two decades?
- Do data structures sufficiently reflect reality?
