I teach human information behavior theory and basic to advanced tools for processing, manipulating, packaging, designing, and disseminating in formation. 
I have a professional background in system administration which mostly now expresses itself through tinkering with automation, system building, and poking around at the Internet of Things. 
My classroom ethos is very much informed by this activity as it allows me to teach students not to worry about breaking thing and to focus on exploration instead.

## Human Information Behavior (INLS 500)

This course is a broad survey of literature in information science which highlights social, cognitive, organizational, institutional, behavioral approaches for understanding and contextualizing interactions between people and information. 
The content of this course underlies much of an ILS curriculum because it introduces students to core concepts with implications for practice as information professionals. 
It also serves in part as a disciplinary onboarding course, in which students become oriented to the theory, methods, and epistemologies of information science. 

Students completing this course will:

1. become familiar with the empirical and theoretical literature related to information seeking, including the recognition of information needs, actions taken to resolve those needs, the roles of intermediaries (both human and machine), and the retrieval and use of information;
2. understand key concepts related to the ways in which information is created, structured, disseminated and used, with particular emphasis on scholarly information behaviors;
3. be able to investigate the ways in which the context of an information interaction can affect the process and outcomes of that interaction;
4. be able to investigate information behaviors and practices, including the impact of technology on human information interactions; and
5. critically apply theories and empirical findings to the definition and solution of problems related to human information interactions.
