</ol>

<p>This last step is important for paella. When you open the lid it will be very steamy and the rice will be very wet and soupy. You have to cook off most of the liquid and let the rice at the bottom of the pot get brown and develop a slight crust. This is crucial. Watch it and check it occasinally to make sure the bottom of the rice is not burning. </p>

<p>You can remove the shrimp and shell them at this time as well if you like. Serve onto plates with cilantro or paprika to garnish. If you used peeled shrimp, just plate it as is.</p>
