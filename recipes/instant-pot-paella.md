## Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to saute function 10 minutes at normal level.  
2. Add butter and olive oil to pot and melt (about 1 minute).  
3. Add onions and cook until softened, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes).  
4. Add garlic and cook for about 1 minute more.  
5. Add red peppers.  
6. Add paprika, turmeric, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and saffron threads.  
7. Stir and cook for about 1 minute.  
7. Add rice and stir. Cook for about 1 minute.  
8. Add white wine and stir to deglaze.  
9. At this point the saute function timer should have finished.  
10. Add the peas and carrots and stir once to disperse them.  
11. Add chicken/vegetable broth/stock, making sure all rice is covered.  
12. Add shrimp on top. Put the lid on and make sure valve is set to sealing.  
13. Set Instant Pot to Manual Mode and with a 5 minute timer.  
14. When timer finishes, quick release.  
15. Once the silver drops down and it is dafe to to open the lid, open it and remove the lid.  
16. Set the Instant Pot to the saute function for 8-10 minutes at normal level.  

This last step is important for paella. When you open the lid it will be very steamy and the rice will be very wet and soupy. You have to cook off most of the liquid and let the rice at the bottom of the pot get brown and develop a slight crust. This is crucial. Watch it and check it occasinally to make sure the bottom of the rice is not burning. 

You can remove the shrimp and shell them at this time as well if you like. Serve onto plates with cilantro or paprika to garnish. If you used peeled shrimp, just plate it as is.
