<h1 class="content-listing-header sans">{{ site.author }}</h1>

My name is {{ site.author }}, and I am a PhD student in the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

My work focuses on trust and credibility in interfaces, systems, and other intermediaries that facilitate information exchange and transfer between people. In short, two questions motivate my work: 

1. What makes us trust the information we are presented with?
2. What motivates us to offer up our information to impersonal, machine-based interfaces?

Through this work, I explore the underlying epistemologies embedded in the technologies and information systems that surround us, and are sometimes completely transparent to us. 

I have an academic background in the humanities: first in classics and then in the history and culture of the Islamic world. 
While studying and working in the Middle East, I became interested cultural institutions and the ways that they codified and preserved information historically. 
This interest, and professional work in archives and libraries led me to pursue the PhD in information science. 
This field has given me the opportunity to explore the nature of human interactions with information as a mode of social exchange.
